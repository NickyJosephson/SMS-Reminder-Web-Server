A simple web server application that ultizes auth0 to authenticate users, and sends SMS notifications based on a school schedule uploaded in the .ICAL file format.
To run the web server, run index.js. You can also run the actual SMS Reminder Application by importing the ScheduleManager class and running .listen() and .start(), but they really should be ran seperately from eachother (ie. on seperate docker containers)
